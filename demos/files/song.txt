But you drew me in, you cleaned me
So take me home, beam me up
Before you do, just let me tell the truth
And let these folks know that I done seen your love
And it's everlasting, infinite
It goes on and on, you can't measure it
Can't quench your love

And it's everlasting, infinite
It goes on and on, you can't measure it
Can't quench your love
